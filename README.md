# ChefRecipes


This is a simple recipe which installs Apache server on Linux machine, installs and starts the Apache service, and finally adds a system user for the Operating System. 
It can be run on a Chef Workstation by firing the command:
chef-apply apacheinstall.rb

Please note: I wrote this on Ubuntu, if youre running this on cent OS, Apache service would be httpd
